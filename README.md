# tetris-opus

## Purpose

A quick experiment to evaluate how easily the **Claude Opus 4.6** model can create a fully self-contained web application running **Tetris** — built entirely in a single HTML file (or minimal set of files) with no external dependencies.

## Goals

- Test Claude Opus 4.6's ability to generate a complete, playable Tetris game as a web app
- The game should be self-contained (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundled together)
- Evaluate code quality, correctness, and completeness of the AI-generated output
- Minimal to no manual intervention — the model should produce a working game in a single pass if possible

## How to Run

Once the Tetris app is created, simply open the HTML file in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
