# 2D Platformer

A simple web-based side-scrolling platformer game built as a single-level experiment.

## Purpose

Test out creating a super basic, single-level side-scrolling platformer game as a web app. The goal is to explore fundamental 2D platformer mechanics in a browser environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API).

## Planned Features

- **Single level** with a defined start and end
- **Side-scrolling** camera that follows the player
- **Basic platformer mechanics**: running, jumping, and landing on platforms
- **Simple collision detection** with platforms and obstacles
- **Minimal visuals** — focus on gameplay mechanics over art

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- CSS for page layout

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to play the game (once implemented).
