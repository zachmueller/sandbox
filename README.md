# tetris-sonnet

## Purpose

Re-attempt at creating a simple Tetris web app, this time using the **Sonnet 4.6** model.

## Background

This branch explores building a functional Tetris game as a single-page web application. The goal is to evaluate how the Sonnet 4.6 model approaches the task of generating a complete, playable Tetris implementation — comparing its output and approach against prior attempts.

## Goals

- Build a simple, playable Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Keep the implementation self-contained (ideally a single `index.html` file or minimal file set)
- Evaluate the quality and completeness of the Sonnet 4.6 model's output for this task
