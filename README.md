# Pac-Man Game

A simple Pac-Man type game built as a browser-based experience.

## Overview

This branch contains a classic Pac-Man style arcade game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a fun, playable game that captures the essence of the original Pac-Man — navigating a maze, eating pellets, avoiding ghosts, and racking up a high score.

## Planned Features

- **Maze navigation** — A grid-based maze that Pac-Man can move through
- **Pellet collection** — Dots/pellets scattered throughout the maze for Pac-Man to eat
- **Ghost enemies** — AI-controlled ghosts that chase Pac-Man
- **Power pellets** — Special pellets that temporarily allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts
- **Score tracking** — Points awarded for pellets and ghosts eaten
- **Lives system** — Multiple lives with game over on depletion
- **Keyboard controls** — Arrow key movement
