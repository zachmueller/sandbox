# Chinese Wordle (汉字 Wordle)

A simple web app game inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but using Chinese characters instead of English letters.

## Concept

Players attempt to guess a target Chinese word within a limited number of tries. After each guess, feedback is provided to indicate how close the guess is to the target word — similar to the color-coded tile system in the original Wordle.

## Goals

- Build a clean, browser-based game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Support guessing Chinese characters (汉字) with visual feedback per character
- Keep the game simple and fun, accessible to learners and native speakers alike
- Explore mechanics unique to Chinese (e.g., tonal hints, radical-based clues, pinyin input)
