# Minesweeper

A simple, browser-based Minesweeper game built from scratch.

## Overview

This branch contains the implementation of a classic Minesweeper game. The goal is to create a clean, playable version of the iconic puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no external dependencies required.

## Planned Features

- **Classic Minesweeper gameplay** — left-click to reveal cells, right-click to flag potential mines
- **Configurable grid size and mine count** — support for beginner, intermediate, and expert difficulty levels
- **Flood-fill reveal** — clicking an empty cell automatically reveals all connected empty cells
- **Timer and mine counter** — track elapsed time and remaining unflagged mines
- **Win/loss detection** — game ends when a mine is revealed or all safe cells are uncovered
- **Clean, responsive UI** — playable in any modern browser

## Getting Started

Once implemented, simply open `index.html` in a browser to play.
