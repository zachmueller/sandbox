# Pinball

A simple pinball-style game built as a sandbox experiment.

## Description

This branch is dedicated to creating a simple pinball type game. The goal is to build an interactive, browser-based pinball experience with core mechanics including:

- **Flippers** — Player-controlled paddles to keep the ball in play
- **Ball physics** — Realistic bouncing, gravity, and collision detection
- **Bumpers & obstacles** — Score-boosting elements placed around the table
- **Score tracking** — Points awarded for hitting targets and bumpers
- **Launch mechanism** — Spring-loaded plunger to launch the ball into play

## Tech Stack

The game will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API) to keep it lightweight and runnable directly in the browser with no additional dependencies.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to play the game (once implemented).
