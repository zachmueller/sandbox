# Choose Your Own Adventure

A simple "choose your own adventure" style game built as an experiment in this sandbox repo.

## Purpose

This branch explores building an interactive text-based adventure game where the player makes choices that determine the story's path and outcome. The goal is to test out game design patterns, branching narrative structures, and a lightweight implementation approach.

## Goals

- Build a simple, playable choose-your-own-adventure game
- Experiment with branching story/decision trees
- Keep the implementation lightweight and easy to run (e.g., browser-based with HTML/CSS/JS)

## Status

🚧 Work in progress
